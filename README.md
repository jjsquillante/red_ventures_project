### Red Ventures Project
___

Visit URL: https://jjsquillante.github.io/red_ventures_project/

### PLEASE READ: 
1. Please reference the code within `/rvProject` (the top level code was compiled by harp.js - not an ideal structure, imo)
2. Due to the time constraint, I was unable to add any filter logic to update DOM based on results.
3. The modal is an AJAX request, so, if the modal is a tad bit slow to open, it's due to the site hosting the api (they throttle usage on free plans)

### Structure
1. The code within `/rvProject` is structured as below:
	+ layout file that acts as the 'index', which brings together the partials.
	+ `js/` contains app.js
	+ `partials/` will contain partial for navigation and modal. 
	+ `style` contains css (desktop and mobile versions).

#### Tasks
- [x] HTML/CSS from scratch 
- [x] Vanilla JS for UI
